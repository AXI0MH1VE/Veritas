# Veritas Roadmap

## Architect & Originator: Alexis M. Adams

This roadmap outlines the development vision for Veritas, an open-source, operator-owned AI auditing toolkit for source-data triangulation and logical coherence analysis.

## Project Vision

Veritas was conceived and designed by **Alexis M. Adams** to address the critical need for transparent, accountable AI systems. The project embodies a commitment to:

- **Operator Ownership**: Ensuring humans remain in control of AI decision-making
- **Transparency**: Making AI processes auditable and understandable
- **Source-Data Triangulation**: Validating information across multiple sources
- **Logical Coherence**: Analyzing AI outputs for consistency and reasoning integrity

## Guiding Principles

As we develop Veritas, we remain committed to:

- **Open Source First**: All core functionality remains freely available
- **Human-Centric Design**: Tools serve operators, not replace them
- **Privacy & Security**: Data protection built into every layer
- **Accessibility**: Usable by technical and non-technical auditors
- **Interoperability**: Works with existing AI systems and tools
- **Scientific Rigor**: Evidence-based approaches to AI auditing
