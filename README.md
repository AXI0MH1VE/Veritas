# Veritas
## AI Auditing Toolkit: Technical Summary

**Architect & Creator:** Alexis M. Adams

## Architecture

Veritas is designed as a modular, extensible Python-based framework for auditing AI system outputs through source-data triangulation and logical coherence analysis.

### Core Components:

1. **Source Validation Engine**
   - Multi-source data retrieval and comparison
   - Citation verification system
   - Cross-reference mapping

2. **Coherence Analysis Module**
   - Logical consistency checking
   - Internal contradiction detection
   - Reasoning chain validation

3. **Scoring Framework**
   - Quantitative reliability metrics
   - Configurable weighting system
   - Transparent scoring methodology

4. **Reporting Interface**
   - Detailed audit trails
   - Visual coherence maps
   - Exportable verification reports

## Algorithms

### Source Triangulation Algorithm

```
1. Extract claims from AI output
2. Identify verifiable assertions
3. Query multiple authoritative sources
4. Compare source agreement levels
5. Flag discrepancies and unsupported claims
6. Generate confidence scores per claim
```

### Logical Coherence Analysis

```
1. Parse output into logical statements
2. Build dependency graph of claims
3. Identify contradictory statements
4. Verify reasoning chains
5. Detect circular logic
6. Score internal consistency
```

## Scoring Formula

Veritas Reliability Score (VRS) is calculated as:

```
VRS = (w₁ × S) + (w₂ × C) + (w₃ × T)

Where:
- S = Source Verification Score (0-100)
- C = Coherence Score (0-100)
- T = Traceability Score (0-100)
- w₁, w₂, w₃ = Configurable weights (default: 0.4, 0.4, 0.2)
```

### Component Scores:

**Source Verification Score (S):**
```
S = (verified_claims / total_claims) × 100
```

**Coherence Score (C):**
```
C = 100 - (contradiction_count × penalty_factor)
```

**Traceability Score (T):**
```
T = (cited_sources / total_assertions) × 100
```
